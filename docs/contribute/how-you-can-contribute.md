# Contribute to ZEUS

ZEUS is free and open-source software (FOSS) with volunteer contributors from all around the world.

We welcome, appreciate, and encourage new contributions from anyone. No matter what your talent may be, we always have work that needs to be done to improve ZEUS.

Below are some common ways contributors help out with the project. Contributions are not limited to this list and if you have a skill to offer outside that you think would be valuable to ZEUS, feel free to message us on our [Nostr](https://iris.to/zeus@zeusln.app), [Telegram](https://t.me/ZeusLN), or shoot us an [email](emailto:zeusln@tutanota.com).
