# Choose your path

ZEUS is a mobile Bitcoin wallet that can both run a node and wallet on your phone and manage multiple remote connections. You can connect various nodes not just one, depending on your needs and usage.

# Embedded node

If you don't have a remote node or account to connect to, you can also use our [embedded node](/category/embedded-node), which will run on your phone. This is the simpler path that most people will choose.

# Remote connections

ZEUS supports connections for LND and CLN nodes, and lndhub accounts, through different types of platforms, networks, configurations etc.

[Please choose your specific node platform](/category/remote-connections/) to see more details about how to configure your remote connection.
