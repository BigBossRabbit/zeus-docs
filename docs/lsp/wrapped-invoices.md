# Wrapped invoices

Wrapped invoices are invoices with extra layers around them. In this instance, the LSP will wrap an invoice generated from your node. The wrapped invoice will appear as if it is generated by the LSP.

This has two benefits:

1) The end user doesn't have to expose their node's public key to senders. The LSP knows the receiver but no one else does.
2) Senders can use routes to the LSP to make a payment instead of having to find a direct path to the end user.

Wrapped invoices uses the same preimage hash as the original invoice. This means that the LSP can't settle the payment without the final receiver completing the payment, so the LSP can't run away with the user's funds.

Be sure to keep Zeus open when receiving payment as the LSP cannot settle payments on your behalf when you're offline.
