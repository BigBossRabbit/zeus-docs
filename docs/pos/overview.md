Zeus has a point of sales function that is built into the main application. Retails can use it to tap into their <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale/software">Square</a> terminals and have their customers pay with bitcoin.  It's currently being used in production at multiple locations including New York City's <a href="https://pubkey.bar/">Pubkey</a>.
